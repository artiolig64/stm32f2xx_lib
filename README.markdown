STM32F2XX Standard Peripheral Library
=====================================

This repository has the purpose of mirroring and adapting the releases of the STM32F2XX libraries.
The newest, original version of the library is kept on the upstream branch, so changes can be merged into the master branch.
It can then be used as a git submodule in the xpcc library.
Only the contents of the 'Libraries' folder is put here to save space.

Latest version can be downloaded at:
